# ðŸŽ® GamifiedLearning

GamifiedLearning is an educational or learning type app supporting the wider UNSW community enabled by elements of gamification.

This project is part of a university course on mobile application development using the Android platform.

## Scope and purpose 

Our final project objective is to deliver an Android-based application (with .apk file format) that encourages students to learn about space travel and future Mars exploration missions. The app is mainly targeting UNSW university students, where students can revise basic revision notes for NSW HSC physics topics, before learning more advanced physics concepts in lectures. The study progress can be examined by the quizzes, where a live leaderboard is implemented using Firebase. Quizzes are implemented into a storyline of taking a rocket to Mars, where obtaining a perfect score allows the user to move on to another stage.   

## Installation
Use the .apk file to install the application to your Android device<br />
